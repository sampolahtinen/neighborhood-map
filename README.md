# Neighborhood Map

This is the final project for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree program. It is a simplistic mimic of Google Map. The application displays interesting places around users location. This information is pulled via Foursquare explore places API (https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api/venues/explore). Furthermore, if a map marker is clicked more details of the selected venue is displayed by using Foursquare Venue details API (https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api/venues/details).

## Installation
1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to the folder via terminal
3. Launch the application with serve -s build
4. Enjoy!
